- The Singleton Pattern is a [[Creational Patterns|creational design pattern]] that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In other words, it restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and provides a way to access that instance from anywhere in your code.
- Key characteristics of the Singleton Pattern:
	- **Single Instance**: 
		- The Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the class.
		- It achieves this by controlling the creation of objects and allowing access to a single instance.
	- **Global Access Point**:
		- It provides a global point of access to the instance, meaning that any part of the code can easily access and use the single instance.
	- **Lazy Initialization**: 
		- The Singleton instance is typically created only when it's first requested, which is often referred to as "lazy initialization." This is useful for reducing resource usage if the Singleton is not always needed.
	- **Thread Safety**: 
		- In multithreaded environments, it's crucial to implement the Singleton pattern in a thread-safe manner to ensure that only one instance is created, even if multiple threads request the instance simultaneously.


```
public class Singleton {
    // Private static instance of the Singleton
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent direct instantiation
    private Singleton() {
        // Initialization code, if needed
    }

    // Public method to provide global access to the Singleton instance
    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
